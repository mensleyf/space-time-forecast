Comments for the Authors
The paper covers an important and relatively poorly researched issue: how the needs and characteristics of forecasting models change with forecast horizon. I.e. what types of model and information are suitable for shorter-term forecasts and what for longer-term forecasts.

The Introduction suggests/states that: Short-term dynamics are a result of initial conditions, births, deaths. And long-term dynamics evolutionary and ecological selection, colonization, extinction. And intermediate-term a bit of both. And hence that forecasting based on single site temporal data should be better for short-term forecasts, while forecasting based on across site (where sites vary in environmental conditions) data should be better in the long-term.

My understanding is that in the community turnover example the abundance of a focal species initially increases due to temperature becoming closer to its optimum, and then decreases due to increased competition since more species have higher temperature optima (what would happen if species optima were symmetric around the baseline temperature, or skewed the other way?).

In the eco-evo example there appears to be classical evolutionary rescue, with the population size initially decreasing due to the negative growth rate caused by maladaptation caused by environmental change, and then recovery due to selection for adapted genotypes increasing growth rate above 0.

In both examples, forecasts based on the temporal data were better in the short-term, while those based on spatial data were better in the long-term, as hypothesized. A mix of the two approaches provided good forecasts at all forecast intervals. However, the mixing approach precluded direct comparison with the other two approaches (line 175-182). Overall, the expectations based on verbal arguments were well supported by the simulations.

The text sometimes refers to the “time scale” of forecasts, sometimes the forecast horizon, and sometimes to their “term”, e.g. short-term. More consistent terminology might help readers. Also I wonder if the term “time-scale” could also mean scale in the sense of forecasting a daily mean, weekly mean, monthly mean, etc. 

TO DO: MORE CONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY ON TIME SCALES AND MODELS 

Would it be preferable, due to greater generality across taxa of very different sizes and life spans, to use number of generations as the units of time, rather than absolute time? Though clearly absolute time is often of considerable practical concern. 

It may be beneficial to explain why time-series models capture “fast processes”, and clarify if they can *only* capture such fast processes (lines 41-44), and if so why. Comparison of their features with space-for-time would be aided if the ability of time-series modeling approaches to include longer-term relationships between environmental and ecological response was addressed.

TO DO: EXPLAIN WHY TIME SERIES MODELS TYPICALLY DON’T CAPTURE SLOW PROCESSES (DATA LIMITS)

How dependent is the overall result on the apparent assumption that available (for the forecast model) spatial variation in environmental conditions is greater than the available temporal variation (as seems to be the case during the baseline period in both examples)? Put another way, how much do the findings depend on the nature of the interannual variation in temperature during the baseline period, relative to outside the baseline period?

TO DO: ADDRESS THIS? IT’S REALISTIC

Line 110, please clarify here that stationary does not mean constant, perhaps using similar language as on line 147. Similarly, please state at or close to line 119 what differs among sites.

TO DO: ADDRESS

Was the weighting parameter constrained to vary smoothly through time (as in figure 3c) or was this temporal smoothness an outcome of the smoothness with which the relative importance of the processes changed? It seems that it could be a smooth function, with parameters estimated, if it was not.

Please make the dashed line in figure 4b clearer, and clarify if it should appear to be linear (it seems to not be, though is hard to see), though the caption suggests it would be.

TO DO: ADDRESS

The Discussion is interesting.

I just noticed this apparently quite relevant paper: Chevalier, M. & Knape, J. (2019). The cost of complexity in forecasts of population abundances is reduced but not eliminated by borrowing information across space using a hierarchical approach. Oikos.

TO DO: WORTH CITING, DOESN’T CHANGE ANYTHING

Comments for the Authors

Overall, I had difficulty with the presentation of the material which is written as though it applied to most modelling, whereas it actually seems to refer to a small subset of models used to predict population size of short-lived organisms using timeseries or occupancy data to predict population size on a step ahead basis

In particular, the authors completely overlook the concept of predicting system behaviour under novel conditions. As such, I wasn't sure who the audience was, nor why the presented ideas were not described as being limited to this type of analysis.  

In addition, the use of overly general multiple example models further implies that the authors are discussing some surprising generalization instead of a particular attribute of short term predictions using non-mechanistic models.

The authors need to state specifically that they are describing these types of models, and provide fewer more detailed exams, preferably using real data

Line specific comments
39 What about process models that use data from various processes to predict future states? These models do not use time series to fit (although certainly predictive ability may be evaluated with a hindcast), so why would they be described as fitting models to long-term data sets? 

There is no necessary correlation between studying short time intervals (however defined), and limited spatial extent. North American models of invasive species spread spring immediately to mind.

55 Climate matching models of invasive species do indeed proceed in this way, and this correlative approach limits their usefulness in predicting the outcomes for novel conditions and complicated short-term dynamics. Hence the use of mechanistic models instead.

66 And again…. this kind of correlative model will never be able to predict far into the future with novel conditions. As far as I can tell, because the authors are not clear, …. this entire paper is discussing the problems associated with inferring the dynamical landscape from system behaviour. It is astonishingly difficult to distinguish transient behaviour from asymptotic behaviour let alone infer mechanism from timeseries…. which is why this approach is limited.

72 "At short forecast horizons (days to years), dynamics will reflect the physiological and demographic responses of the organisms present at a site more than turnover of genotypes or species" I find this statement highly suspect… we have evidence that long term impacts of ecological interactions have large impacts on current dynamics, and surely it depends on the species in question?? How does tree demography compare to soil micro-organisms here, and what is most influenced by what?

TO DO: CLARIFY AND JUStIFY FOCUS ON PHENOM. MODELS IN INTRO RATHER THAN DISCUSSION, ADDRESS INTRO COMMENTS. ADDRESS ISSUE OF NOVEL ENV CONDITIONS IN DISCUSSION?

Comments for the Authors
The manuscript by Adler et al consider two different approaches to ecological forecasting which they name as: (i) the time series approach and (ii) the space-for-time approach. The authors try to compare the applicability of the two approaches for various time scales and eco-evolutionary scenarios (short term and long term). They also apply a weighted approach by averaging the two above approaches. The efficiency of ecological forecast is tested in the paper by using time series from some mathematical models of population dynamics.

Overall, the paper looks rather confusing. Firstly, it is not clear the difference between the time series approach and space-for-time one. The authors claim that space-for-time approaches should be used for long-term predictions. However, now days it is well recognised that the spatial component is crucial for ecological modelling and short term predictions, so in many cases data sets are collected at different spatial cites to make short term forecast. On the other hand, long term predictions for some isolated ecosystems (e.g. islands) do not require in principle exhaustive analysis of spatial components.

TO DO: ??? DISTINGUISH “SHOULD” FROM COMMON PRACTICE

Secondly, the authors suggest some weighted combination of both approaches. This is fine, but they do not provide any practical recommendation of how to choose the weights. Moreover, they show that the weights are not constant but should vary in time. I agree that in the case where we already know the underlying dynamics we can always fit weights to obtain suitable predictions. However, what should we do in the case of complete uncertainty? 

Thirdly, almost all mechanistic (dynamical) models used as examples are not well explained.
TO DO: NOT SURE WHAT IS NOT CLEAR, DID REVIEWERS LOOK AT SUPP INFO?

Finally, the authors often use the word ‘model’ with a different meaning. Sometimes they mean statistical (regression) model, sometimes dynamical (‘mechanistic’) model, or sometimes extrapolation (predictive) model. This is confusing.

TO DO: DISTINGUISH SIMULATION MODELS FROM STATISTICAL MODELS

Some recently developed methods of ecological forecasting used short time series are missed in this paper (Pennekamp et al., 2019,  Ecological Monographs, Deyle, 2016, Proc R Soc. B).

NOT RELEVANT, THIS IS ABOUT INTRINSIC PREDICTABILITY

Editors Comments for the Author(s):
We have now received three reviews of the manuscript, "Matching the forecast horizon with the relevant ecological processes."  Unfortunately, given the nature of these reviews and the exceptional competition for space in Ecology Letters, I believe it is necessary to reject this manuscript.  The first reviewer views the manuscript quite positively, primarily on the grounds that the characterizing the forecast horizon of different models is an important and poorly studied area, though has some thoughtful suggestions to improve the manuscript.  The second reviewer struggled with the presentation and lack of detail regarding the modeling assumptions involved, and expresses concerns about generality of the claims based on the examples shown.  The third reviewer highlights similarly fundamental concerns. Most importantly, the this reviewer brings up the extensive literature on dynamic spatial models that do not fall neatly into the typology of models presented in the manuscript (the reviewer does not provide citations but perhaps is thinking along the lines of Levin 1992, https://doi.org/10.2307/1941447 and subsequent literature).  These processes cannot in general be estimated without data across both time and space.
