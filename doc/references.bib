  abstract   = {1.â€‚A change in a climate variable may alter a speciesâ€™ abundance
	not only through a direct effect on that speciesâ€™ vital rates,
	but also through â€˜indirectâ€™ effects mediated by species interactions.
	While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects
	overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations
	to predict the strength of indirect effects. 2.â€‚For communities
	dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential
	for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength
	of stabilizing niche differences. 3.â€‚We tested this hypothesis
	by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population
	model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population
	growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected
	the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of
	climate perturbations. 4.â€‚Consistent with our hypothesis, speciesâ€™
	sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing
	stabilization by niche differences. 5.â€‚Synthesis. Information about
	niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects
	of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches
	are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization
	will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected
	data.},

	However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution
	models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially
	lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally
	realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes
	of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving
	rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three
	types of lag: â€œdispersal lagsï¿½? affecting plant speciesâ€™ spread
	along elevational gradients, â€œestablishment lagsï¿½? following their
	arrival in recipient communities, and â€œextinction lagsï¿½? of resident
	species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species
	in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered
	biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment.
	Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially
	to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions
	on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic
	community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities
	might lag behind simple expectations based on speciesâ€™ range shifts
	with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution
	of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community
	turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming.
	Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium
	range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns
	of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation

	and the services they provide going to change in the future?ï¿½? and
	â€œHow do human decisions affect these trajectories?ï¿½? Answering
	these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes.
	Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale
	climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term
	(daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison
	of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data,
	one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts
	provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses

	process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting
	models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative,
	near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it
	more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making
	under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify
	the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges
	for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade,
	data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but
	challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification.
	Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying
	computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities
	exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure.
	Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training,
	culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now;
	the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning
	by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

	that populations in warmer or wetter parts of a species' range should
	respond negatively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation,
	respectively, whereas populations in colder or drier areas should
	respond positively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation.
	To test this, we estimated the population sensitivity of a common
	shrub species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), to annual climate
	variation across its range. Our analysis includes 8,175 observations
	of year-to-year change in sagebrush cover or production from 131
	monitoring sites in western North America. We coupled these observations
	with seasonal weather data for each site and analyzed the effects
	of spring through fall temperatures and fall through spring accumulated
	precipitation on annual changes in sagebrush abundance. Sensitivity
	to annual temperature variation supported our hypothesis: years with
	above average temperatures were beneficial to sagebrush in colder
	locations and detrimental to sagebrush in hotter locations. In contrast,
	sensitivity to precipitation did not change significantly across
	the distribution of sagebrush. This pattern of responses suggests
	that regional abundance of this species may be more limited by temperature
	than by precipitation. We also found important differences in how
	the ecologically distinct subspecies of sagebrush responded to the
	effects of precipitation and temperature. Our model predicts that
	a short-term temperature increase could produce an increase in sagebrush
	cover at the cold edge of its range and a decrease in cover at the
	warm edge of its range. This prediction is qualitatively consistent
	with predictions from species distribution models for sagebrush based
	on spatial occurrence data, but it provides new mechanistic insight

The hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to understand and forecast the growth and geographic spread in the prevalence of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We compare statistical inference and forecasts from our hierarchical Bayesian model to phenomenological regression-based methods that are commonly used to analyse spatial occurrence data.

Evaluating the level of confidence is particularly important when predictions are used to guide conservation or restoration decisions. We used a multi-model approach to predict climate change impacts on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), the dominant plant species on roughly 43 million hectares in the western United States and a key resource for many endemic wildlife species. To evaluate the climate sensitivity of A. tridentata, we developed four predictive models, two based on empirically derived spatial and temporal relationships, and two that applied mechanistic approaches to simulate sagebrush recruitment and growth. This approach enabled us to produce an aggregate index of climate change vulnerability and uncertainty based on the level of agreement between models. Despite large differences in model structure, predictions of sagebrush response to climate change were largely consistent. Performance, as measured by change in cover, growth, or recruitment, was predicted to decrease at the warmest sites, but increase throughout the cooler portions of sagebrush's range. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sagebrush performance responds more strongly to changes in temperature than precipitation. Most of the uncertainty in model predictions reflected variation among the ecological models, raising questions about the reliability of forecasts based on a single modeling approach. Our results highlight the value of a multi-model approach in forecasting climate change impacts and uncertainties and should help land managers to maximize the value of conservation investments.},

Many predictions of responses to future climate change utilize ecological niche models (ENMs). We assess the capacity of these models to predict species distributions under conditions that differ from the current environment by testing whether they can predict past distributions of species.


Location

From 43°?S to 31°?S in south-eastern Australia (including Tasmania).


Methods

We studied three dominant tree species of temperate Australian mesic forests, Atherosperma moschatum, Eucalyptus regnans and Nothofagus cunninghamii. Phylogeographic evidence indicates that these species each survived the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in multiple refugia. We modelled the current distribution of each species and projected those models onto LGM climates under six palaeoclimatic scenarios. The support for phylogeographic-based glacial refugia was estimated under each scenario using three different thresholds for inferring species presence/absence.


Results

The LGM models under scenarios that allowed for a realistic level of rainfall failed to predict survival of the study species in refugia identified from genetic evidence, apart from those in perhumid western Tasmania.


Main conclusions

Correct prediction of nearly all modern occurrences of the species suggests that this failure of ENMs to predict refugial survival was not methodological. Rather we conclude that the existing realized niches of these species may have changed since the LGM. Such niche changes may have involved the occurrence of non-analogue climates in the LGM and some significant alteration of fundamental niche (for at least E.?regnans). Our results emphasize that predictions of future impacts of climate change on biodiversity will benefit from awareness of the limitations of ENMs in predicting the extinction of populations/species. Greater knowledge of how niches have changed through time and how this relates to the characteristics of species is needed to improve the reliability of ENMs. Niche changes in plants may also affect palaeoclimatic estimates based on fossil pollen.},

We examined population response to climatic variation using long-term incidence data (collected over 42 years) encompassing 149 butterfly species and considerable habitat diversity (10 sites along an elevational gradient from sea level to over 2,700 m in California). Population responses were characterized by extreme heterogeneity that was not attributable to differences in species composition among sites. These results indicate that habitat heterogeneity might be a buffer against climate change and highlight important questions about mechanisms maintaining interpopulation differences in responses to weather. Despite overall heterogeneity of response, population dynamics were accurately predicted by our model for many species at each site. However, the overall correlation between observed and predicted incidence in a cross validation analysis was moderate (Pearson's r = 0.23, SE 0.01), and 97\% of observed data fell within the predicted 95\% credible intervals. Prediction was most successful for more abundant species as well as for sites with lower annual turnover. Population-level heterogeneity in response to climate variation and the limits of our predictive power highlight the challenges for a future of increasing climatic variability.},

These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation, and increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises. Most ecological models are at least partially parameterized from modern observations and so may fail to accurately predict ecological responses to these novel climates.

The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers, such as species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits. Evolutionary processes also need to be incorporated into management programmes designed to minimize biodiversity loss under rapid climate change. These challenges can be met through realistic models of evolutionary change linked to experimental data across a range of taxa.},

Estimating the distribution and abundance of colonizing species is critical for efficient management or conservation. We describe a statistical framework for simultaneously estimating spatiotemporal occupancy and abundance dynamics of a colonizing species. Our method accounts for several issues that are common when modeling spatiotemporal ecological data including multiple levels of detection probability, multiple data sources, and computational limitations that occur when making fine-scale inference over a large spatiotemporal domain. We apply the model to estimate the colonization dynamics of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in Glacier Bay, in southeastern Alaska.},

Statistical methods for spatiotemporal processes are powerful, yet difficult to implement in complicated high-dimensional settings.

These formulations are able to account for the various sources of uncertainty and can incorporate scientific judgment in a probabilistically consistent manner. In particular, analytical diffusion models can serve as motivation for the hierarchical model for invasive species. We demonstrate by example that such a framework can be utilized to predict, spatially and temporally, the relative population abundance of House Finches over the eastern United States.

  abstract  = {Aim Species distribution models are important tools used to study the distribution and abundance of organisms relative to abiotic variables. Dynamic local interactions among species in a community can affect abundance. The abundance of a single species may not be at equilibrium with the environment for spreading invasive species and species that are range shifting because of climate change. Innovation: We develop methods for incorporating temporal processes into a spatial joint species distribution model for presence/absence and ordinal abundance data. We model non-equilibrium conditions via a temporal random effect and temporal dynamics with a vector-autoregressive process allowing for intra- and interspecific dependence between co-occurring species. The autoregressive term captures how the abundance of each species can enhance or inhibit its own subsequent abundance or the subsequent abundance of other species in the community and is well suited for a ‘community modules’ approach of strongly interacting species within a food web. R code is provided for fitting multispecies models within a Bayesian framework for ordinal data with any number of locations, time points, covariates and ordinal categories. Main conclusions We model ordinal abundance data of two invasive insects (hemlock woolly adelgid and elongate hemlock scale) that share a host tree and were undergoing northwards range expansion in the eastern U.S.A. during the period 1997–2011. Accounting for range expansion and high inter-annual variability in abundance led to improved estimation of the species–environment relationships. We would have erroneously concluded that winter temperatures did not affect scale abundance had we not accounted for the range expansion of scale. The autoregressive component revealed weak evidence for commensalism, in which adelgid may have predisposed hemlock stands for subsequent infestation by scale. Residual spatial dependence indicated that an unmeasured variable additionally affected scale abundance. Our robust modelling approach could provide similar insights for other community modules of co-occurring species.},

These processes are often characterized by non-linear time dynamics that include interactions across multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability. The datasets associated with many of these processes are increasing in size because of advances in automated data measurement, management and numerical simulator output. Non-linear spatio-temporal models have only recently seen interest in statistics, but there are many classes of such models in the engineering and geophysical sciences. Traditionally, these models are more heuristic than those that have been presented in the statistics literature but are often intuitive and quite efficient computationally. We show here that with fairly simple, but important, enhancements, the echo state network machine learning approach can be used to generate long-lead forecasts of non-linear spatio-temporal processes, with reasonable uncertainty quantification, and at a fraction of the computational expense of a traditional parametric non-linear spatio-temporal models.

Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were ?72\% as accurate as “time-for-time” predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients. Despite this caution, our results generally support the judicious use of space-for-time substitution in modeling community responses to climate change.},

In particular, to test whether the predictive ability of SDMs depends on species traits or the inclusion of land cover and soil type, and whether distributional changes at expanding range margins can be predicted accurately. Location Finland Methods Using 10-km resolution butterfly atlas data from two periods, 1992–99 (t1) and 2002–09 (t2), with a significant between-period temperature increase, we modelled the effects of climatic warming on butterfly distributions with boosted regression trees (BRTs) and generalized additive models (GAMs). We evaluated model performance by using the split-sample approach with data from t1 (‘non-independent validation’), and then compared model projections based on data from t1 with species' observed distributions in t2 (‘independent validation’). We compared climate-only SDMs to SDMs including land cover, soil type, or both. Finally, we related model performance to species traits and compared observed and predicted distributional shifts at northern range margins. Results SDMs showed fair to good model fits when modelling butterfly distributions under climate change. Model performance was lower with independent compared with non-independent validation and improved when land cover and soil type variables were included, compared with climate-only models. SDMs performed less well for highly mobile species and for species with long flight seasons and large ranges. When forecasting changes at northern range margins, correlations between observed and predicted range shifts were predominantly low. Main conclusions SDMs accurately describe current distributions of most species, yet their performance varies with species traits and the inclusion of land cover and soil type variables. Moreover, their ability to predict range shifts under climate change is limited, especially at the expanding edge. More tests with independent validations are needed to fully understand the predictive potential of SDMs across taxa and biomes.},

We tested the performance of ENMs using fossil distributions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼21 000 yr ago). We compared hindcast ENM LGM distribution hypotheses for five species of small mammals, drawn from the published literature, to the known LGM fossil record for those species and found a consistent southern prediction bias in the ENMs. This bias urges caution in interpreting future range predictions, and we suggest that the Pleistocene and Holocene fossil record should be used as an additional resource for calibrating niche modelling for conservation planning.},

Though statistical climatic envelope models are frequently used to project future scenarios for species distributions under climate change, these models are rarely tested using empirical data. We used long-term data on bird distributions and abundance covering five states in the western US and in the Canadian province of British Columbia to test the capacity of statistical models to predict temporal changes in bird populations over a 32-year period. Using boosted regression trees, we built presence-absence and abundance models that related the presence and abundance of 132 bird species to spatial variation in climatic conditions. Presence/absence models built using 1970–1974 data forecast the distributions of the majority of species in the later time period, 1998–2002 (mean AUC = 0.79 ± 0.01). Hindcast models performed equivalently (mean AUC = 0.82 ± 0.01). Correlations between observed and predicted abundances were also statistically significant for most species (forecast mean Spearman′s ρ = 0.34 ± 0.02, hindcast = 0.39 ± 0.02). The most stringent test is to test predicted changes in geographic patterns through time. Observed changes in abundance patterns were significantly positively correlated with those predicted for 59\% of species (mean Spearman′s ρ = 0.28 ± 0.02, across all species). Three precipitation variables (for the wettest month, breeding season, and driest month) and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the most important predictors of bird distributions and abundances in this region, and hence of abundance changes through time. Our results suggest that models describing associations between climatic variables and abundance patterns can predict changes through time for some species, and that changes in precipitation and winter temperature appear to have already driven shifts in the geographic patterns of abundance of bird populations in western North America.},

However, tests of their predictive skill in the real-world are rare. Here, we use data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder program, one of the longest running and most extensive marine biological monitoring programs, to investigate the reliability of predicted plankton distributions. We apply three commonly used SDMs to 20 representative plankton species, including copepods, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, all found in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas. We fit the models to decadal subsets of the full (1958–2012) dataset, and then use them to predict both forward and backward in time, comparing the model predictions against the corresponding observations. The probability of correctly predicting presence was low, peaking at 0.5 for copepods, and model skill typically did not outperform a null model assuming distributions to be constant in time. The predicted prevalence increasingly differed from the observed prevalence for predictions with more distance in time from their training dataset. More detailed investigations based on four focal species revealed that strong spatial variations in skill exist, with the least skill at the edges of the distributions, where prevalence is lowest. Furthermore, the scores of traditional single-value model performance metrics were contrasting and some implied overoptimistic conclusions about model skill. Plankton may be particularly challenging to model, due to its short life span and the dispersive effects of constant water movements on all spatial scales, however there are few other studies against which to compare these results. We conclude that rigorous model validation, including comparison against null models, is essential to assess the robustness of projections of marine planktonic species under climate change.},

Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.},

  abstract      = {Anticipating ecological changes is paramount if we are to manage biodiversity and the services they provide to humanity. When forecasting population abundances, studies have shown that simple statistical models often have better forecast performance than complex models. These studies have evaluated forecasts of models fitted separately to data from single sites (single-site approach). Here, we aim to contrast the forecast performance and forecast horizon between a single-site approach and a hierarchical multi-site approach where a single model is fitted to data from multiple-sites, and to investigate how they vary with model complexity. We used 5273 population time series on 84 species from the Swedish breeding bird survey program, and found that simple models on average had better forecast performance and forecast horizon than complex models for both the single- and the multi-site approach. However, the cost of complexity was considerably reduced under the multi-site approach, while the proportion of species for which complex models had better forecast performance than simple models was also much larger than under the single-site approach. This suggests that the multi-site approach is useful for inclusion of more detailed processes which may benefit forecasts for some species and which are of importance for managers. Still, our results are in line with some previous studies suggesting that it is surprisingly difficult to construct complex models that, on average, beat trivial baseline forecasts.
